    <h2>What is the purpose of a function?</h2>
    <p>
      A function is a reusable code block that has a specific purpose in a
      computer program.

    <script>
      let username = prompt("Enter your name");
      let gas = calcGasAvg();   
      console.log(gas); //testing to see if it works

      confirm(username + "'s average weekly gas bill is " + gas.toFixed(2));

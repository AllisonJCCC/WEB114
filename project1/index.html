        <h3>What is the purpose of JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is used to interact with content on websites as well as the user.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> 1. JavaScript can modify HTML and CSS.</li>
            <li> 2. JavaScript can react to user actions such as mouse clicks, pointer movements, and key presses.</li>
            <li> 3. JavaScript can send information to servers or download/upload files.
            </li>
        </ul> 
        <br>
        <h3>Who invented JavaScript and when?</h3>
        <p>Brendan Eich in 1995</p>
        <h3>What software program will you be using to write JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>We will be using a code editor. <br>
           Some options are Visual Studio Code (cross-platform, free) and WebStorm (cross-platform, paid). <br>
           I will be using Visual Studio Code. 
        </p>
        <h3>What software program will you be using to run JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>JavaScript can run on any device with a program called the JavaScript engine.<br>
           We will be using a compiler, more specifically a browser such as chrome or Firefox.
        </p>
        <h3>Why are external scripts preferable to scripts added directly within an HTML file?</h3>
        <p>Simply scripts are put into HTMl while more complex are in separate files. <br>
           When scripts are put into separate files, the browser will download and save it.<br>
           This allows websites to load quicker.
        </p>
        <h3>What's the point of all of those console.log() statements?</h3>
        <p>Coders use this as a tool to help debug. It will not be seen on the browser.</p>
        <h3>What's the difference between how you reference a variable versus a string in a JavaScript statement?</h3>
        <p>When referencing a variable as a string quotes are required. 
           Coders can use double quotes, single quotes, or backticks.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> 1.	Double quotes: "Hi World!"</li>
            <li> 2. Single quotes: 'Hi World!'</li>
            <li> 3. Backticks: `Hi World!`</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>What's the difference between a single value and an expression in a JavaScript statement?</h3>
        <p> A single value (literal value) is data that represents itself. <br>
            Single values can be numbers, strings, Booleans, null, and undefined. <br>
            An expression is a combination of one or more values, variables, operators, and function calls that produces a resulting value.
        </p>
        <script>
            "use strict";
            alert("Hi World!");// added a script to alert "Hi World!" as requested
            console.log("Hi Katie"); // added a statement to console.log("Hi Insert Your Name"); 
        </script>
        <script>
            "use strict";
            const myName = "Katie";
            let mySalary = 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000;
            console.log("My name is " + myName + " and my salary is " + mySalary);
            mySalary = 150000;
            console.log("My name is " + myName + " and my new salary is " + mySalary);
            let veteran = false; 
            console.log(typeof(myName));
            console.log(typeof(mySalary));
            console.log(typeof(veteran));
            console.log(' ' + 1 + 0 );
            console.log(' ' - 1 + 0 );
            console.log(true + false );
            console.log('This statement did math since a number is first: ' + 6 / "3" );
            console.log('This statement did not do math since a string is first: ' +  "2" * "3" );
            console.log('This statement did not do math since a string is first: ' + 4 + 5 + "px" );
            console.log('This concatenates the dollar sign to the numbers ' + '$' + 4 + 5 );
            console.log( '4' - 2 );
            console.log('This gives an NaN since there is text with the minus sign ' + '4px' - 2 );
            console.log(7 / 0 );
            console.log('This does not do math since the 9 is text. ' + '  -9 '  + 5 );
            console.log("  -9  " - 5 );
            console.log(null + 1 );
            console.log(undefined + 1);
            let x = 5; //
            let y = 1 + (x *= 2); 
            /*
            Let's break down the expression let y = 1 + (x *= 2); step by step:

            x is initially 5.
            x *= 2 is equivalent to x = x * 2, so x is multiplied by 2, making x equal to 10.
            1 + (x *= 2) is 1 + 10, which equals 11.
            The value 11 is assigned to the variable y.
            After this code executes, x will be 10 and y will be 11.
            */

            console.log(x); // x is assigned to 10 because x was reassigned using the short hand  x = 5 * 2
            console.log(y); // y is assigned to 11 because 10 + 1 = 11

        <h1> QUESTIONS </h1>
        
        <h2> 01. What is the purpose of JavaScript? </h2>
          <p> The purpose of JavaScript is to make web pages interactive. It is a scripting language that allows developers to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. </p>
          <p> JavaScript is used to add interactivity to web pages in a variety of ways, such as:
            <ul> 
            <li> Validating form input </li>
            <li> Creating dynamic menus and drop-downs </li>
            <li> Adding animations and transitions </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        <br>
        <h2> 02. Who invented JavaScript and when? </h2>
          <p> JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> 03. What software program will you be using to write JavaScript? </h2>
          <p> I will be using Visual Studio Code to write JavaScript. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> 04. What software program will you be using to run JavaScript? </h2>
          <p> I wil be using a Chrome web browser to run it. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> 05. Why are external scripts preferable to scripts added directly within an HTML file? </h2>
          <p> External scripts are preferable because they can be reused across multiple HTML pages. This can save time and effort. External scripts also keep your HTML code clean and organized. </p>

        const myName = 'Allison';
        let mySalary = 100000;
        console.log("My name is " + myName + " and my salary is " + mySalary);
        mySalary = 150000;
        console.log("My name is " + myName + " and my new salary is " + mySalary);

        console.log(6 / "3");
        console.log("2" * "3");
        console.log(4 + 5 + "px");
        console.log("$" + 4 + 5);

        let x = 5;
        x = x * 2;
        let y = x + 1; 

        //let y = 1 + (x *=2); this is BAD FORM. It's confusing and poor programming.


        console.log(x); //X was calculated by multiplying 5 by 2
        console.log(y); //Y was calculated by adding 1 to 10

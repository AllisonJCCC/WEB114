            <li>Name a situation where you would need to create an "if" statement.  (There are many answers to this question. )</li>
            <li>When comparing values,  in what data type is the result stored?</li>

            <li>Using if statements is essential for validating user input or checking correctivity. For example, if a user tries to enter an invalid name when you're asking for a user's name, then JS will spit out the exact value, and we don't want that.</li>
            <li>When comparing values, the data type returned is a boolean value (true or false).</li>
